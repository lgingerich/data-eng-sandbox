`airflow_manager.sh`

I want your help in developing a bash script for macos which deploys airflow with helm charts running on local host.
this script will be called `airflow_manager.sh`. i want a function in the bash script `setup` that does all
dependency installation, airflow setup, and anything else to get running with port forwarding to local host. 
then i want another function `run` which almost does the same thing as `setup`, but it skips dependency setup. 
i essentially want to use this in cases where i've done `setup`, then shut things down but didn't destroy any resources,
and i just want to again get local host access. then i want a `shutdown` function which turns things off but doesn't fully
destroy resources. then i want a `teardown` function which does normal shutdown and also destroys all running resources
such that it looks like nothing was ever running.

below are some principles to follow while developing this code:
- install dependencies with proper version checks and checks if already installed
- ensure robust error handling to check for errors after each command execution
- ensure idempotency so that there are no conflicts or leftover resources after running any functions in any order
- handle graceful shutdowns, particularly related to ports
- cleanup all resources in the teardown process
- wait for readiness in pods and other necessary infra before proceeding to next steps
- ensure proper and detailed logging
- be careful with handling port availability
